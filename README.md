# GeoLocation #

This is a Python project built with Flask.
It utilizes the Google Geocoding API to filter and define a location for the user.

This web application was designed to help me get a better grasp of the Flask web framework and practice developing MVC web applications.

With minimal effort, such an application could be converted into a web survey that
collects information from users about specific topics related to locations, to be
used for data analysis.
